\paragraph*{1: Nearest Points}
For a given point $(a,b) \in \bbR^2$, we want to find the nearest
point $(x,y)$ that lies on the hyperbola $xy = 1$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Write a Lagrangian function $L(x,y,\lambda)$ such that the
  desired point is a stationary point of $L$.
\item
  Write a Newton iteration to find the stationary point of $L$
  for $(a,b) = (3,4)$.  Use the starting guess $(x,y,\lambda) =
  (a,b,0)$, and demonstrate quadratic convergence.
\end{enumerate}
{\em Note:} As the point is to demonstrate a knowledge of Lagrange
multipliers, we will not give credit for solutions that eliminate
the constraint in advance.

\paragraph*{2: Nonlinear Least Squares}
In this problem, we consider a nonlinear least squares fitting problem
in which we fit the coefficient vector $\beta$ defining a rational
function
\[
  f(x; \beta) = \frac{\beta_1 + \beta_2 x + \beta_3 x^2 + \beta_4 x^3}
                     {1 + \beta_5 x + \beta_6 x^2 + \beta_7 x^3}
\]
by minimizing
\[
  \phi(\beta) = \sum_j (f(x_j; \beta) - y_j)^2
\]
{\bf Your task:} Complete the MATLAB script {\tt ps8thuber.m} by
filling in the code marked {\tt TODO} with an
appropriate solver iteration.  You may use Gauss-Newton or
Levenberg-Marquardt; I used Gauss-Newton with a line search (necessary
to achieve convergence).  Terminate when $\|J^T (f-y)\| < 10^{-8}$.

\paragraph*{3: Descent directions}
Suppose that $H$ is symmetric and positive definite, and let
$\tilde{p}$ be the solution to the system
\[
  H \tilde{p} = -\nabla \phi(x) + r
\]
where $r$ is a residual vector.  If
$\kappa(H) = \lambda_{\max}(H)/\lambda_{\min}(H)$,
show that if $\kappa(H) \|r\| < \|\nabla \phi\|$
then $\tilde{p}$ is a descent direction. \\[2mm]
{\em Hint:} Note that if $A$ is any SPD matrix, then we have
the two-norm bounds
\[
  \forall u, v, \quad
  |u^T A v| \leq \|u\| \|A\| \|v\| = \lambda_{\max}(A) \|u\| \|v\|
\]
and
\[
  \min_{u \neq 0} \frac{u^T A u}{u^T u} = \lambda_{\min}(A),
  \mbox{ so }
  \forall u, u^T A u \geq \lambda_{\min}(A) \|u\|^2.
\]
