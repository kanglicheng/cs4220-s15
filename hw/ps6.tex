{\bf Note:} While it is not assigned, you may wish to look at problem
10 if you're still thinking about Project 2.

\paragraph*{1: By the book}
Book section 8.4, problem 7, parts (a), (b), and (d).  For part (d),
you may also assume the initial vector $v_0$ is non-negative.

\paragraph*{2: Simply SVD}
Consider the iteration
\begin{lstlisting}
  for k=1:kmax
    u = A*v;  s = norm(u); u = u/s;
    v = A'*u; s = norm(v); v = v/s;
  end
\end{lstlisting}
Argue that {\tt u}, {\tt v}, and {\tt s} correspond to the first left
and right singular vectors $u_1$ and $v_1$ and the dominant singular
value $\sigma_1$, assuming $\sigma_1 > \sigma_2$.  What is the rate
of convergence?

\paragraph*{2: Subspace iteration}
Implement orthogonal iteration on a $m$-dimensional space
(see the book, page 239).  Your function should have the interface
\begin{lstlisting}
  function [V,R] = p6subspace(A, m, maxiter, rtol)
\end{lstlisting}
and should iterate until either {\tt maxiter} iterations have been
reached or until the approximation $V^{(k)}$ satisfies the tolerance
\[
  \|A V^{(k)} - V^{(k)} R^{(k)}\|_F < \mbox{rtol}.
\]
You should start your iteration with a random orthogonal basis, which
you can compute with the line
\begin{lstlisting}
  [V,R] = qr(randn(n,m), 0);
\end{lstlisting}
